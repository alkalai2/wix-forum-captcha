# Wix Forum CAPTCHA

The source file is a snippet of JS that can be added to a Wix Forum such that a CAPTCHA challenge is required to be completed before users can access the forum. 

It uses the [Wix CAPTCHA API](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/$w/captcha), and can be added to the Forum page of a wix site as custom JS.
