# Wix Forum CAPTCHA

The source file is a snippet of JS that can be added to a Wix Forum such that a CAPTCHA challenge is required to be completed before users can access the forum. 
While this integration is for the Forum, it can be updated to guard any aspect of a Wix page with a CAPTCHA. 

It uses the [Wix CAPTCHA API](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/$w/captcha). The snippet can be added to a wix site as custom JS from Developer Mode.

<i> Note: </i> For this to work a Wix reCAPTCHA element was first added onto the page using the Wix Editor, and by default hidden.
